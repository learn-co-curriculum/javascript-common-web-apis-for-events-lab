# Lab - Common Web APIs for Events

## Overview

This lab will further help you understand the concepts surrounding Common Web APIs for Events.

Flatapets wants to improve its website to allow its admin users to upload images for pets that are available for adoption using a file chooser and use a drag-and-drop feature to drag and drop the pet images from a list of displayed pet images to display the details for the dragged pet image. You will need to use your knowledge of Common Web APIs for Events to complete this lab.

## Tools and Resources

It is recommended that you use the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) IDE for this lab.

Useful considerations and terminology:

**HTML Form**: A form for user input that is created by a `<form>` element that consists of opening and closing `<form>` tags that enclose one or more `<input>` elements where users can enter information, and a way to submit the form.

**Event**: Something a user does on a web page or something that happens on a web page.

**Event handler**: A callback function that executes code in response to an event.

**submit event**: An event that occurs when a user clicks on a `<button>` element or an `<input>` element whose `type` attribute is set to `submit` within a `<form>` to submit a form on a web page.

**load event**: An event that occurs once all contents of a file have loaded (in the case of a `FileReader` object that is listening for the `load` event).

**dragstart event**: An event that occurs when a user starts dragging an element or text selection.

**dragover event**: An event that occurs when an element or text selection is being dragged over a valid drop target.

**drop event**: An event that occurs when an element or text selection is dropped on a valid drop target.

## Instructions

In this lab, you will practice working with the File API to retrieve file data from a file chosen using a file chooser, and the HTML Drag and Drop API to add a drag-and-drop feature to a web page.

**Fork and clone** this lab into your local environment. Navigate into its
directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files in Visual Studio
Code.

Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.

Write your code in the `index.js` file. There is some starter code provided in `index.js`.

These are your tasks:

1. Add an event listener to the `<form>` element with the id of `new-pet-form` that will allow the `<form>` element to listen for the `submit` event and will call the `handleSubmit()` function in response to the `submit` event.
2. `handleSubmit(event)`: The `handleSubmit()` function has been declared for you, but you will need to write the code that should go inside of this function. It has 1 parameter named `event` whose value should be a `SubmitEvent` object when the correct value is passed as an argument into the function (Hint: You can check the value of a parameter or variable using `console.log()`). When the `handleSubmit()` function is called, the following actions should take place:
    - The `preventDefault()` method is called on the `SubmitEvent` object to prevent the page from refreshing.
    - The `File` object for the file chosen from the file `<input>` element with the id of `new-image` is stored into a variable named `file`.
    - A new `FileReader` object is created and stored into a variable named `fileReader`.
    - An event listener is added to the `FileReader` object, referenced by the `fileReader` variable, that will allow the `FileReader` object to listen for a `load` event and will call the `handleLoad()` function in response to the `load` event.
    - The `readAsDataURL()` method is called on the `FileReader` object, referenced by the `fileReader` variable. The `File` object, referenced by the `file` variable, is passed in as an argument to the `readAsDataURL()` method.
3. `handleLoad(event)`: The `handleLoad()` function has been declared for you, but you will need to write the code that should go inside of this function. It has 1 parameter named `event` whose value should be a `ProgressEvent` object when the correct value is passed as an argument into the function (Hint: You can check the value of a parameter or variable using `console.log()`). When the `handleLoad()` function is called, the following actions should take place:
    - An `object` is created and stored into a variable named `newPet`. The `object` contains the following key and value pairs:
      - A key of `name` whose value is set to the value of the `value` attribute of the `<input>` element with the id of `new-name`.
      - A key of `image` whose value is set to the value of the `result` key of the `FileReader` object (Hint: You should be able to access the `FileReader` object from `event.target`, if the `event` parameter has the correct value).
      - A key of `description` whose value is set to the value of the `value` attribute of the `<textarea>` element with the id of `new-description`.
    - The `addMovieToList()` function is called and the `object` referenced by the `newMovie` variable is passed in as an argument to the `addMovieToList()` function.
4. `addPetImageToPetsDiv(pet)`: The `addPetImageToPetsDiv()` function has been declared for you and most of the code for this function has been written for you. It has 1 parameter named `pet` whose value is an `object` that contains the following keys: `name`, `image`, and `description`. Write the code to add an event listener to the `<img>` element, referenced by the `imgElement` variable, that will allow the `<img>` element to listen for a `dragstart` event. When the event handler (callback function) for the event listener is called, the value of the `draggedPet` variable is set to the value of the `pet` parameter from the `addPetImageToPetsDiv()` function. The `draggedPet` variable has been declared for you in global scope.
5. Add an event listener to the `<img>` element with the class of `detail-image` that will allow the `<img>` element to listen for the `dragover` event. When the event handler (callback function) for the event listener is called, the `preventDefault()` method is called on the `DragEvent` object to allow for the `drop` event to occur on the `<img>` element.
6. Add an event listener to the `<img>` element with the class of `detail-image` that will allow the `<img>` element to listen for the `drop` event. When the event handler (callback function) for the event listener is called, the `displayPetDetails()` function is called and the `object` referenced by the `draggedPet` variable is passed in as an argument to the `displayPetDetails()` function.
